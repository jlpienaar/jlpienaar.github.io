The no-bullshit guide to QBism

Point 1: QBism's goal is to tell us about reality

Most interpretations say "here is reality. It is like this". Since they are talking about the reality that underpins quantum mechanics, their realities are usually pretty weird in some way or another. QBism is not likely to be different in that regard -- whatever picture of reality it gives us will likely also be weird. The point is that it will be weird in a new and exciting way (at least that is the QBist's hope). Where QBism differs from the other interpretations is that it does not start by saying "reality is like such-and-such". Instead it does the opposite. It begins by taking an extremely skeptical view. The true QBist-at-heart is a person who says: "nothing is real until its reality is forced upon me, so that I cannot ignore it". Such a person is very difficult to talk to when they are in a philosophical mood and feeling very skeptical. The following conversation might happen with a QBist:

You: "I have a chair in my room that is real." 
QBist: "It's not real until I sit on it." 
You: "But I sat on it just now! Don't you believe me?" 
QBist: "I'm sure it's real to you. But I don't have direct access to your experiences. Until I sit on it, I say, it isn't real to me". 
Finally you cave in. You invite them to sit on your chair. 
You: "Is it real to you now?" 
QBist: "Oh yes, it is indeed. A lovely chair." 
After leaving your room, you say:
"How happy I am that my chair is now real to you!"
QBist: "It's not real to me now. I'm not sitting in it, am I?"

So you see, it is hard to catch them out. But let us see if we can do it. Suppose you keep careful watch on the QBist and one day you catch him searching for chairs to buy on eBay.

You: "Aha! I caught you."
QBist: "What do you mean?"
You: "You say you don't believe a chair is real unless you are sitting in it, right? So just what are you doing right now then? Shopping for something you don't believe is real? Haha!"
QBist: "Well, yes, that's exactly what I'm doing. I'm shopping for something that isn't real right now. But it will be when I sit in it."
You: "Oh come on. If it isn't real right now, what are those pictures of on your computer screen?"
QBist: "I've come to realize that these pictures are a pretty good way to predict what the chair will be like when I do finally sit in it."
You: "Okay I'll humour you. Why do you believe these pictures are a good way to predict your yet-to-be-real chair? And don't tell me it is from past experience -- I happen to know this is the first chair you bought online."
QBist: "Well, it is from past experience. Just not the experience of online shopping, specifically. But I have enough personal experience of cameras, photographs, chairs, and companies that sell things to me from catalogs, to believe that it is very likely that these images will correlate strongly with my future experience of sitting in the chair."

At this point you realize that you will never catch the QBist out in a logical fallacy. The most infuriating part is that he continues to live a normal life and get away with it. Surely someone who didn't believe their own chair was real would be terrified to try and sit down on it, lest their bottom should go right through thin air and hit the floor -- but the QBist sits down with as much confidence as anyone else that his bottom will meet the yet-to-be-real cushion. What a hypocrite! Yet when you challenge him on this point, he is as stubborn as ever.

QBist: "Just because I am certain right now that the chair will hit my bottom in a moment from now, doesn't make the chair real to me right now."
You: "But then why aren't you surprised when it happens?"
QBist: "Why should I be surprised? It has never failed me before. Whenever I see it, I've learned that I can count on it supporting me when I sit on it. So much so that I take it practically as an article of faith. On the contrary, I should be really surprised if one day I saw it and sat down, only to pass through thin air!"
You: "But if you're certain that you'll be able to sit in it anytime you see it, why don't you just admit that you regard it as `real'?"
QBist: "Well, yes, I suppose I could do that with chairs and probably plenty of other everyday things. But just try doing the same with an electron. Would you say an electron is really at a certain position in the moment before a detector finds it there?"
You: "Not in general, but I would if I were certain where it was going to be. Like if it were in a position eigenstate."
QBist: "Oh indeed? So you agree with `the EPR criterion of reality' then? Hoo boy, you're in for trouble..."
You: "Never mind the electrons, how is this relevant to chairs?"
QBist: "I'm just trying very hard to be consistent. And honestly, declaring that a chair is only real when I sit in it has in no way diminished my ability to reason about and anticipate chairs in my life." 
You: "It hasn't?"
QBist: "Not at all. In fact it reminds me that my ideas and preconceptions about chairs are quite different to the actual experience of the chair. A real chair always has the ability to surprise me, say with a certain springiness of the cushion that no catalog photograph could have conveyed, or the unpleasant discovery of a mouldy potato chip wedged in the seat. It keeps me humble and reminds me that there's more to real chairs than what I can possibly anticipate in the abstract. I'd say it is you who are the more deluded, thinking that your impoverished mental model of a chair that you carry around when you're not sitting in one is any approximation to the real thing."

The QBist, then, is a person who is skeptical above all of the concept of `reality'. Just what function is this label `reality' supposed to serve? The QBist makes a principled point of stubbornly refusing to use it whenever he can get by without it. What is remarkable, then, is that there are certain things that the QBist cannot avoid describing as `real'. For instance, the chair when he is sitting in it. We can think of the QBist's stubbornly skeptical attitude as a kind of acid that eats away at everything we naturally want to call `reality', and leaves behind only the bare bones, the things whose reality cannot be denied. It could be debated whether this attitude is really a productive one to have towards things like chairs (as our caricatured QBist insists). However, amidst a crowd of different voices all preaching their own version of `quantum reality', maybe the acid of QBism is just the kind of antidote we need, to dissolve what only pretends to be real, and get to the bottom of what is undeniably real.
