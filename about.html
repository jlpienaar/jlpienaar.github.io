							<h2>What does quantum mechanics tell us about reality?</h2>

						<p>That's the question that got me started in physics. <br />
						Now, after more than 15 years of intense study, I can finally say that I have no idea.

						My website is just a bunch of simple HTML files that I edit by hand. There are no trackers, ads, analytics, or any of that disgusting internet trash - this is a clean site. (My <a href="https://pienaarspace.wordpress.com/about/">My old blog</a>, on the other hand, is full of it... sorry!) By visiting my site, nobody learns anything about you. I hope you enjoy this feeling of not being spied on, quantified, analyzed, and treated like a factory product.  
						</p>
						<p>
						I don't allow comments on my blog posts because I don't have time to read or reply to them, much less deal with trolls (except you, <a href="https://mateusaraujo.info/2020/10/01/why-qbism-is-completely-empty/" >Mateus Araujo</a>)! If you find a forum where my writing, or QBism generally, is being discussed, please let me know and I will post a link. And who knows, I might just show up there to leave a comment once in a blue moon.

						Yes, the cheesy "contact me" form actually works. It goes to the same email address listed on this site. I can't promise I'll reply in a timely manner, but I do try to read everything that comes through here.
